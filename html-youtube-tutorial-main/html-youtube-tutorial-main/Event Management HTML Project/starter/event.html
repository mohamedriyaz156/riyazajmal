			‚ÄúTake me out, tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù

			It‚Äôs rare to find a band that are as critically acclaimed for their lyrics as much as their music ‚Äì but thanks to Morrissey the magical wordsmith, The Smiths have managed just that. An avid reader, a big poetry fan, and a romantic at heart, Morrissey has written some of the most famous lyrics to emerge from the British music scene in the past 30 years. Their song titles alone contain more poetry than most lyric sheets ‚Äì Shoplifters of the World Unite, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me, There Is a Light That Never Goes Out ‚Äì they‚Äôve even inspired countless tattoos.

		<p> First things first.I'ma say all the words inside my head. I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh. The way that things have been, oh-ooh. Second thing second. Don't you tell me what you think that I could be. I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh. The master of my sea, oh-ooh. I was broken from a young age. Taking my sulkin' to the masses</p>
